Activity: Capture your first packet

Introduction
In this lab activity, you'll capture and analyze live network traffic using tcpdump. You'll use Linux commands in the Bash shell to complete these steps.

Used commands: 'sudo ifconfig' , 'sudo tcpdump -D', 'sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5', 'sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &', 'curl opensource.google.com', 'ls -l capture.pcap', 'sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v', 'sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X'

The -i option indicates the network interface to monitor.

The -v option provides verbose information.

I've gained practical experience to enable me to:

- identify network interfaces
- use the tcpdump command to capture network data for inspection
- interpret the information that tcpdump outputs regarding a packet, and
- save and load packet data for later analysis.
