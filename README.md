# Portfolio

Hey! Great to see you here :)

This is my portfolio, where I will document my progress in learning, contributions to projects, acquired experience and certifications.
I will do my best to make everything clear and readable.

I hope this will help you get a sense of what I can currently do :)

See something that doesn't look right? Reach out to me, I'd be happy to get some help.

Have a nice day!
